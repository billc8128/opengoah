# goah

**Goal-Oriented Agent Harness** — a long-running, goal-oriented agentic system.

Agents handle tasks. goah holds the goal.

## Why

Coding agents are good at bounded tasks: you give one a prompt, it works, it stops. Give one a goal measured in weeks — "keep this repo healthy", "grow revenue to $X/day" — and everything between sessions is on you: remembering the goal, scheduling the next run, checking what the agent actually did, recovering when it crashes mid-flight.

goah is the harness around the agent that owns exactly that layer:

- **The ledger is the agent.** Agent processes are short-lived: hydrate → work → response or Goal Handoff → exit. Everything durable lives in an append-only event ledger; every table is a projection that can be rebuilt from events. Crash recovery is replay, not heuristics.
- **The session is replayable.** User messages, assistant deltas and completed messages, tool calls/results, compaction replacements, and the exact prepared model request are normalized into typed event streams. The active conversation surface is derived from those facts.
- **Every action is accountable.** An external action carries its `reason` and `evidence` (references to ledger events), passes a gate before dispatch, and has crash-safe delivery semantics — a crash mid-dispatch resolves to `unknown`, which is reconciled by querying, never blindly retried.
- **Execution stays local and inspectable.** The runner owns local files, bash, and Git under the directory containing `goah.config.json`. GOAH records process failure and recovery context; coding skills decide how to branch, commit, merge, or preserve partial Git work.
- **Lease ownership is bounded, runner policy is not prescribed.** A live runner continuously renews its fenced wake lease; if the supervisor dies, renewal stops and recovery can terminate the old process. Token, cost, timeout, and handoff-reserve policy belong to each runner implementation.

goah does not replace your agent runner (pi, or any runner that implements the `Runner` interface). It sits above it.

## Status

**Experimental.** Contracts are `0.5.0` / `experimental`. SQLite schema changes use explicit, version-checked migrations; public TypeScript contracts may still change before 1.0.

Implemented and tested today:

- Stream-aware append-only SQLite event kernel with global `seq`, contiguous per-stream `streamSeq`, required/ignorable event semantics, and five standard execution-module projections (`goals`, `schedule`, `wakes`, `mailbox`, `actions`)
- Versioned replayable Session vocabulary with a v0→v1 upgrader, future-version refusal, exact request snapshots, user/assistant/tool events, compaction replacements, and interrupted-tool `unknown` repair
- Deterministic Active Context composition: structured projections render to short Markdown, and the exact model-visible value is retained by `request.prepared`
- FIFO wake lifecycle with leases: per-agent concurrency of one, trigger deduplication, fencing tokens, recorded runner PIDs, and kill-before-recovery semantics
- Action state machine with real evidence validation, human approval/rejection, `unknown` semantics, and query-based reconciliation
- Audit advice write/ack APIs and mandatory injection of unacknowledged advice into the action owner's next context
- Connector capability manifests and isolated connector subprocesses: undeclared capabilities fail closed, ambient secrets are not inherited, automatic retry requires declared native idempotency
- Runner-owned local execution: non-software goals need no Git, while coding agents can use ordinary Git and worktree commands through their skills
- Real runner subprocess boundary with sliding lease renewal, process-group termination, optional runner-specific timeout, and stale-event rejection
- Ordinary Human Turns return normal responses; Goal-bound Turns require a current Work Record revision and compact Goal Handoff
- Mail acknowledged atomically with a valid response or Goal Handoff; abnormal wakes leave messages unread for redelivery
- Injected clocks, schema v1→v8 migrations, indexed bounded queries, and a public ledger conformance suite
- Optional mechanical metric evaluation (missing/stale/sustain/guardrails), a total-silence tripwire, trigger coalescing, FTS5 fact search, and generic evidence-backed actions; Goal itself has no required metric or target
- Official Pi 0.84.2 worker binding with `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash` for every Agent plus model-view-only mid-turn compaction
- Durable textual Goal observation methods with root human confirmation, atomic child assignment, revision invalidation, replay, and evidence-backed completion
- Interactive `goah` CEO shell over a resident Supervisor local control socket, including live goal revisions while Supervisor remains the only SQLite writer
- Event-sourced Work Record filesystem: one versioned semantic document per Goal, organization-wide reads, ownership-checked CAS updates, history, diff, search, and deterministic migration from legacy Handoff/memory
- CEO sole-entry interaction with explicit Human-authorized Goal binding, filesystem-first Goal onboarding, ledger-derived team roster, atomic delegation/reassignment, stale-child action barriers, motion validation, concurrent Goal-owning Agents, and a read-only team dashboard
- Session verifier plus blind-first global audit interfaces, audit-advice delivery, and precision/risk-weighted-recall evaluation
- Repo-guardian reference application, systemd/launchd templates, and an accelerated 30-day replay/continuity soak
- Bidirectional fenced RPC with role capabilities, executable CEO/verifier/audit prompts, versioned configuration, and singleton CLI controls

Operational acceptance evidence **not yet produced**:

- Real 7/14-day wall-clock soak evidence, a public sanitized long-run ledger, calibrated production verifier labels, and explicitly authorized small-money operation

The completed real-model fault canary is documented in [`docs/canary/2026-08-19-ark-v0.3.1.md`](./docs/canary/2026-08-19-ark-v0.3.1.md): four wakes, one deliberate mid-tool SIGKILL, automatic retry, replay/Inspector verification, and two production findings fixed from the recorded evidence.

## Website

The product site lives in [`apps/web`](./apps/web) as a Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-structured application.

```bash
npm run web:dev
npm run web:build
```

## Quick start

Requires Node.js >= 24 (uses `node:sqlite`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/billc8128/opengoah.git
cd goah
npm install
npm test          # contract, replay, Runner routing, organization, recovery, approval, audit, and connector tests
npm run example   # one full wake: goal → schedule → lease → faux run → handoff → done
npm run example:guardian
npm run test:soak
```

Initialize and operate a configured supervisor:

```bash
npm install --global @goah/cli
goah setup
goah doctor
goah "Launch a profitable store"
# Reattach later:
goah --continue
```

After the first install, update in place without remembering how npm was prefixed:

```bash
goah update --check
goah update
```

`goah update` preserves global npm installs and custom-prefix installs such as `~/.goah-tool`. It never invokes `sudo`; permission failures are reported with the exact npm command. Use `--dry-run` to inspect the command or `--version X.Y.Z` to install an explicit version.

The global CLI is the default product path: after installation, `goah` works from any directory and initializes that directory as its local workspace. For TypeScript library integration instead, install `@goah/cli` in the project and use its documented subpath exports.

The normal product flow is an ordinary CEO interaction. Greetings, questions, and bounded work do not create a Goal. Durable Human intent may be translated by CEO into `create_goal`, or created explicitly with `/goal`; from that point the Turn follows strict Goal, Work Record, observation, verification, and Handoff policy. Lower-level Goal controls remain available for inspection, extensions, and Human root authority:

```bash
goah goal-create --id first-goal --owner worker --objective "Complete the first verified handoff" --observation-method "Inspect a fresh evidence-backed handoff" --wake-now
goah goal-show first-goal
goah goal-update first-goal --objective "Updated objective" --observation-method "Inspect evidence for the updated objective"
goah goal-pause first-goal
goah goal-resume first-goal
goah goal-complete first-goal --reason "observation passed" --evidence <seq>
goah status
```

`goah` starts the resident Supervisor when necessary and attaches the interactive CEO. `/goal ...` revises the active root and invalidates its old observation method; `/observe ...` confirms the replacement through human authority. `goah start` remains the explicit daemon command and `goah wake <agent>` queues a manual wake. `goah daemon status|logs|restart|stop` manages the resident process.

Goah Core knows only Runner Profiles. Each Runner owns its configuration semantics: the Pi Runner exposes Pi's built-in provider/model registry, OAuth, API-key environment references, custom endpoints, and local Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp targets. Use `goah runner setup [PROFILE]`, `goah runner profile assign AGENT PROFILE`, `goah auth ...`, and `goah model ...`. OAuth credentials stay in the Runner credential store; only the selected wake's resolved request credential crosses the private worker pipe, never Agent context or the Ledger. For an offline installation check, use `goah init --provider faux`.

Inspect and export the replayable Session ledger without requiring provider credentials:

```bash
goah session list
goah session show <wake-id>
goah session replay <wake-id>
goah context show <wake-id>
goah events --stream wake:<wake-id> [--from 1]
goah session export <wake-id> --output session.json
```

`session show` summarizes event types, request count, replayed messages, and the last Active Context. Export is redacted by default: common secret fields, bearer/API-key patterns, and the current home path are removed while event identities remain intact. `--raw` is an explicit local-only escape hatch and may contain sensitive prompts and tool results.

Runner Profiles allow different Agents to use different execution backends or Pi targets:

```bash
goah runner setup fast
goah runner profile assign worker fast
goah runner status
```

Ark is not a built-in special case. If needed later, configure it as a Pi custom endpoint rather than extending Goah Core.

```

One wake, step by step:

1. A due `schedule` entry becomes a queued `wake` (deduplicated by `(agent, trigger_ref)`).
2. The supervisor leases it — one active wake per agent, lease expiry is crash detection.
3. It assigns immutable Turn source and optional Goal binding. Ordinary interactions receive a bounded conversation view; Goal Turns receive the Goal tree, observation and verification methods, the shared Work Record index, current/parent records, unread mail, actions, and recovery facts.
4. The supervisor starts a runner subprocess only after the wake's lease token and PID are recorded. The child gets Active Context and a local root, never a database connection or connector credentials. Its normalized messages, tool calls, results, and exact requests stream back into the wake ledger.
5. While the process is alive, the supervisor renews its fenced lease. If renewal stops, recovery kills the recorded process before another wake can own the agent. Runner-specific plugins may add token, timeout, cost, or handoff policy.
6. An ordinary response acknowledges only its Human interaction Mail. A Goal Turn must first update its Work Record under the current Goal revision; its compact Handoff then atomically acknowledges consumed Mail, delivers outgoing Mail, and schedules the next Wake. Local project files and Git remain the Runner's responsibility.
7. Any invalid or missing result is `abnormal`: after process death is confirmed, open tool calls receive synthetic `unknown` outcomes and the Session closes as interrupted. A recovery Wake receives the source event slice; unread Mail and committed Work Record history remain available.

External actions follow their own state machine, independent of wake success:

```
requested ─▶ approved ─▶ dispatching ─▶ confirmed
                              │  └────▶ failed
                              ▼
                           unknown ──(query connector)──▶ confirmed / failed  (+ reconciled_at)
```

`unknown` is the honest state after a crash mid-dispatch: the side effect may or may not have happened. The default resolution is querying the connector, never re-dispatching — unless the connector's manifest declares native idempotency and opts into automatic retry.

## Distribution and source modules

Goah publishes one npm package: `@goah/cli`. The internal workspaces remain separate in source, but are bundled into that tarball, so one logical release produces one package version and one npm notification. Framework consumers use subpath exports such as `@goah/cli/kernel`, `@goah/cli/session`, `@goah/cli/sqlite`, and `@goah/cli/supervisor`.

| Source workspace | Public import | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger-contract` | `@goah/cli/kernel`, `/session`, `/execution`, `/metrics` | Generic event kernel, normalized Session vocabulary/replay, execution contracts, and optional metric policy. |
| `ledger-sqlite` | `@goah/cli/sqlite` | Single-writer SQLite ledger and rebuildable standard projections. |
| `supervisor` | `@goah/cli/supervisor` | Scheduler, wake lifecycle, Active Context, action gate, and connector dispatch. |
| `runner-pi` | `@goah/cli/runner-pi` | Pi adapter, process runner, normalized Session events, exact request snapshots, local tools, and compaction. |
| `testkit` | `@goah/cli/testkit` | Simulated clock, faux worker, connector, conformance suite, and fault injection. |
| `cli` | `@goah/cli` | Configuration, singleton daemon, status/doctor, goals, approvals, and dashboard. |

## Security model

Read this before pointing goah at anything real.

Mechanically enforced today:

- No external side effects by default: a connector must declare a capability for an action's kind, and non-dry-run connectors additionally require an explicit supervisor opt-in. Anything undeclared is gated, fail-closed.
- Runner and connector code executes in child processes with bounded environments. Connector secrets are explicitly scoped to that connector; runners never receive a ledger connection. Pi authentication is resolved before a wake starts; the worker receives only that request's scoped auth over its private process pipe, while Pi's Bash subprocess receives no provider API-key variables. Control state defaults to `~/.goah/state`, outside the runner root.
- The events table is append-only (enforced by SQLite triggers); invalid wake/action state transitions are rejected by both the library and the database.
- `request.prepared` records model-visible behavior but excludes provider API keys, authorization headers, abort handles, and transport-private objects.
- Recovery Active Context includes only the abnormal reason, interrupted/compaction markers, and tool calls with unknown outcomes; raw deltas and request snapshots remain in the ledger for explicit inspection.
- Every action evidence sequence must exist. Gated actions require an authorized approval carrying its own reason and evidence.
- Mail survives abnormal wakes, and unacknowledged audit advice is forced into the next context.
- An `unknown` action is never automatically re-dispatched unless the connector manifest explicitly declares native idempotency and automatic retry.

Not guaranteed, by design honesty:

- goah does not make the model's judgment correct. It records reasons and evidence; it cannot verify they are good reasons.
- goah does not defend against prompt injection inside the agent's own context.
- The Pi runner is trusted local code: every Agent has Bash and the operating-system permissions of the user that launched it. GOAH does not sandbox arbitrary shell commands.

| 3 — verification layer | ✅ verifier/global-audit interfaces, blind-first isolation and evaluation implemented; production calibration dataset remains operational work |
| 4 — multi-agent | ✅ interactive CEO, durable observation methods, ledger-derived roster, atomic delegation/reassignment, revision barriers, concurrent child agents, mailbox and dashboard |

## Design

The current architecture source is [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md), with the complete Goal model in [`docs/proposals/goal-bound-agent-operating-model.md`](./docs/proposals/goal-bound-agent-operating-model.md); [ADR 0011](./docs/adr/0011-goal-bound-turns-and-work-record-filesystem.md) records the transition. [`Goah-架构设计-v2.html`](./Goah-架构设计-v2.html), [`Goah-CEO-Agent-Operating-Layer.html`](./Goah-CEO-Agent-Operating-Layer.html), and [`北辰-harness-设计稿.html`](./北辰-harness-设计稿.html) are preserved as historical designs. Decisions are recorded as ADRs in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/).

The user-facing organization layer is documented in [`Goah-CEO-Agent-Operating-Layer.html`](./Goah-CEO-Agent-Operating-Layer.html), with the reviewable Markdown source in [`docs/proposals/ceo-agent-operating-layer.md`](./docs/proposals/ceo-agent-operating-layer.md). Milestones A–C and E are implemented: CEO is the interactive normal entry, every Agent receives the Pi coding baseline, Goal observation methods persist across wakes, team state is derived from Ledger facts, and delegation/reassignment is atomic. The deterministic multi-Agent canary is covered by the test suite; a long-running real-model canary remains operational validation.

## Contributing

The contracts are experimental and moving; issues and discussion are more useful than large PRs right now. Everything runs offline — `npm test` is the whole setup. If you change ledger semantics, add a fault-injection case proving the transaction boundary holds.
